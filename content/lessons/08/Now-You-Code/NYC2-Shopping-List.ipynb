    "\n",
    "Yes, the refactored code in step 4 is easier to read because it is more concise and does not involve as many characters to open and print the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explain how this program could be refarctored further (there's one thing that's obvious).\n",
    "\n",
    "You could refactor the first part of the program which refers to writing over the already existing file with the \"if\" and \"else\" statements. This would allow for the program to be easier to read with less characters to type.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe how this program can be modified to support multiple shopping lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can support multiple shopping lists at the same time by including more files into the program. Instead of just having one file, \"NYC2-shopping-list.txt\" for example, we could include other files for shopping lists in the program as well."
